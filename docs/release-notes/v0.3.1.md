# Release v0.3.1

## Platform Support Expansion

This update mainly expands CI build platform support, now providing more pre-built binaries:

| Platform | Architecture | Status |
|----------|--------------|--------|
| Linux | x86_64 | ✅ |
| Linux | aarch64 (ARM64) | ✅ **New** |
| macOS | x86_64 (Intel) | ✅ Restored |
| macOS | aarch64 (Apple Silicon) | ✅ |
| Windows | x86_64 | ✅ |
| Windows | aarch64 (ARM64) | ✅ **New** |

> Now Linux ARM64 users (like Raspberry Pi 64-bit, AWS Graviton) and Windows ARM64 users can download pre-built versions directly.

## Dependency Optimization

- **git2 dependency slimmed down**: Disabled git2 default features, removed openssl-related dependencies
  - Simplified dependency tree, reduced compile time
  - Improved cross-platform build compatibility
  - Resolved openssl linking issues on some platforms

## Documentation Updates

- README adds `gcop config edit` command usage instructions

## Upgrade Notes

Upgrading from v0.3.0 requires **no action**, fully backward compatible.
